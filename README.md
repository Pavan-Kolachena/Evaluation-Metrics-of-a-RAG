Evaluation Metrics of a RAG

Example: Finding a Restaurant
Layman Terms
Imagine you're using a food delivery app to find a restaurant serving Italian food near your office.
 * Faithfulness: The app shows you restaurants that actually serve Italian food, not Chinese.
 * Answer relevance: The app shows you restaurants that are actually near your office, not across town.
 * Context precision: The app focuses on restaurants with good Italian food reviews, not just any Italian restaurant.
 * Context recall: The app finds most of the Italian restaurants in your area, not just a few.
 * Context entities recall: The app finds restaurants with specific Italian dishes you like, like pizza or pasta.
 * Answer similarity: The app suggests similar restaurants if your first choice is unavailable.
 * Answer correctness: The app provides accurate information about the restaurant's location, hours, and menu.
 * Aspect critique: The app allows you to filter restaurants based on price, rating, or delivery time.
 
Technical Terms
Imagine a system that finds relevant information from a large dataset to answer a query about Italian restaurants near an office.
 * Faithfulness: The system accurately extracts information about Italian cuisine from the dataset.
 * Answer relevance: The system returns restaurants within a specified geographic radius of the office.
 * Context precision: The system prioritizes restaurants with high ratings for Italian food.
 * Context recall: The system retrieves most of the Italian restaurants in the dataset that match the query.
 * Context entities recall: The system identifies specific Italian dishes like pizza and pasta in the retrieved information.
 * Answer similarity: The system suggests alternative restaurants with similar attributes if the top choices are unavailable.
 * Answer correctness: The system provides accurate details about restaurant location, hours, and menu items.
 * Aspect critique: The system allows users to filter results based on specific criteria like price range or customer rating.

RAG System
A RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system combines search and language models to provide more comprehensive and relevant answers. In the restaurant example, the system would retrieve information about Italian restaurants from a database, then use a language model to generate a human-readable response.
The metrics mentioned above help evaluate the performance of such a system. For instance, high faithfulness, answer relevance, and context precision indicate a well-performing RAG system for this task.
